# How to Play

There are a few notes to keep in mind:

- The main point of the game is to win all 52 Cards.
- Higher value number will beat the lower value number in each round.
- If the two numbers are the same, they will go into a war mode where 4 more cards from each deck will be drawn and the last two cards will go into a round of war again for winners take all.
- If the last two cards are the same again, they go to another war untill there is a clear winner.

Instructions:
First enter your name.
Click 'Player 1 Draw' Start playing!

Notes:
You are able to reset the game at any point.
There will be a display of the winner when its determined.
